This repository made for certification course **BIOINFORMATICS FOR BIOLOGISTS: ANALYSING AND INTERPRETING GENOMICS DATASETS** by WELLCOME CONNECTING SCIENCE.

### In this cousre i learned about:
* Next Generation Sequencing and its significance in genomics,
* the installation of widely-used bioinformatics tools,
* the use of different file formats
* Linux commands for sequence quality control, mapping, and variant calling.
* The analysis was also performed using the workflow management system Nextflow and applied to viralrecon, an existing bioinformatics pipeline.
* Downstream analysis included RStudio data visualization of variants obtained from genomic data sample.
